                                <br>
                                <b style="color: rgb(1, 19, 43);"> Here's What You'll Need:</b>
                                <br>
                                <b style="color: rgb(0, 3, 8);">
                                    <b style="color: rgb(16, 16, 97);">Heat the oven to 450Â°F: Place a rack in the
                                        lower third of the oven and heat to 450Â°F. Sprinkle a baking sheet lightly with
                                        flour and set aside.<br>
                                        Mix together the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour,
                                        sugar, and salt.<br>
                                        Add the oil and water: Add the oil and water to the flour mixture. Stir until a
                                        soft, sticky dough is formed. If a lot of loose flour remains in the bottom of
                                        the bowl and the surface of the dough, add more water a tablespoon at a time
                                        until all the flour is incorporated.<br>
                                        Divide and shape the dough into a square: Divide the dough into two halves and
                                        set one half aside. Sprinkle your work surface lightly with flour and set the
                                        other half on top. Pat it into a thick square with your hands.
                                        Roll out the dough: Working from the center of the dough out, roll the dough
                                        into a rectangle roughly 1/8-inch thick or thinner. If the dough starts to
                                        shrink back as you roll it, let it rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes and then
                                        continue rolling.<br>
                                        Sprinkle dough with topping (optional): Brush the surface of the dough very
                                        lightly with water. Combine the seeds in a small bowl and sprinkle half of them
                                        (roughly 1 1/2 tablespoons) evenly over the surface of the dough. See Additional
                                        Notes below for additional ideas for toppings and flavorings.<br>
                                        Cut the dough into cracker-sized rectangles: Using a pizza cutter or a sharp
                                        knife, cut the dough into individual crackers roughly 1-inch by 2-inches.
                                        Alternatively, cut the crackers into squares, diamonds, or use cookie cutters.
                                        Transfer crackers to baking sheet and prick with fork: Transfer the crackers to
                                        the baking sheet using a metal dough scraper or spatula. It's fine to crowd the
                                        crackers very close to each other. Prick each cracker with the tines of a fork
                                        to prevent them from puffing during baking.<br>
                                        Bake for 12-15 minutes: Bake the crackers in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until
                                        the edges are browned. Thinner crackers will bake more quickly than thicker
                                        ones; you can remove the crackers as they brown to your liking and continue
                                        baking the rest. While the first batch of crackers is baking, roll out and cut
                                        the remaining dough.<br>
                                        Cool and store the crackers: Transfer the baked crackers to a wire rack to cool
                                        completely. The crackers will crisp further as they cool. Store the crackers in
                                        an airtight container on the counter for 3-5 days. If you're crackers are a
                                        little old and less-than-crispy, lay them on a baking sheet and put them in a
                                        350Â°F oven for a few minutes to re-crisp.<br>
                                        <br> Enjoy! <br><br>
